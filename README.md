#### Hi, I'm Oscar

I don't really have the time to add stuff here for the moment.

I'm a Software Engineer based in Los Angeles, California.

I like to build cool stuff using Javascript frameworks.

I know Angular, React, React Native, Flutter and native Swift.
I've also built apps using Java, Kotlin, C, C++ and C#, but also Symfony and more.

Bye!
